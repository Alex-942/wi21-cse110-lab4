1. The issue is that we are intending to add the inputs as ints using the + operator. However, when we enter the inputs enter the text boxes, these inputs are being stored as strings. So when we do + on two strings we get the concatenation of the the strings. To fix this we would just have to convert the strings to integers before using the + operator.
